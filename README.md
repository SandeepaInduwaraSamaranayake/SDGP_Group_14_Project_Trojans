### Project Description

Pets play a significant role in a person's life. Pets can be an important and valued part of people's lives, providing companionship, love, and support. They can also have numerous physical and mental health benefits for their owners. Pet care is a vital aspect of responsible pet ownership and involves providing for the basic needs of a pet, including food, shelter, water, grooming, and medical attention. It also involves providing socialisation, exercise, and mental stimulation for the pet. Proper pet care is essential for the health and well-being of a pet and can help to improve their quality of life and lifespan. Based on the information gathered through interviews and surveys, it has been determined that most pet owners do not devote enough time to pet care in today's hectic  lifestyle because it is no longer as simple as it once was. Lack of awareness regarding proper pet care can be another significant issue, as it can lead to poor health and well-being for pets. Finding a straightforward method for growing pets has therefore been one of the major challenges. Utilising innovative new technologies is the ideal solution for this type of issue. The main aim of this research is to create a pet care application specifically created for Sri Lankan pet owners that will possess all the required facilities and services to manage all pet-related activities. The initial objective of the suggested solution, BarkMeow, is to provide a non-exhaustive, unique experience with great features, including identifying a dog’s breed, connecting with pet-related communities, and managing pet records and activities efficiently through the application. <br>
